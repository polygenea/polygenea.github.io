The id is to be used as a "fragment identifier" as defined by [RFC 3986, Section 3.5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.5). As such, the constraints of the id are provided in the definition of the media type (e.g. XML, JSON) of the data structure.
attribution | The attribution of this subject. | `http://gedcomx.org/Attribution` | OPTIONAL. If not provided, the attribution of the containing data set (i.e., `Reasoning`) of the `ReasoningNode` is assumed.

It is RECOMMENDED that the `id` of each `ReasoningNode` be the (upper-case) initial letter of the name of the `ReasoningNode`s element type (which will be one of {"A", "C", "D", "E", "I", "P", "S", "T"}),  followed by the (non-padded) decimal string representation of 0-based index of the `ReasoningNode` within its containing element.
